# semancomm-sbox


Welcome to **semancomm-sbox**! 🚀

This is my personal playground for experimenting with **Semantic Communications**. This repository serves as a sandbox where I explore different concepts, models, and strategies for optimizing and understanding communication at the semantic level. 

> **Disclaimer:** This is purely experimental. Please do not judge, do not conclude. However, any suggestions are always welcome!

## 🌌 **What is Semantic Communication?**
Semantic Communication goes beyond traditional bit-level communication by focusing on the meaning of the transmitted information. It aims to improve communication efficiency by understanding and transmitting only the relevant semantic information required for the intended task.
