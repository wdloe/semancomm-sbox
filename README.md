# semancomm-sbox


Welcome to **semancomm-sbox**! 🚀

This is my personal playground for experimenting with **Semantic Communications**. This repository serves as a sandbox where I explore different concepts, models, and strategies for optimizing and understanding communication at the semantic level. 

> **Disclaimer:** This is purely experimental. Please do not judge, do not conclude. However, any suggestions are always welcome!

## 🌌 **What is Semantic Communication?**
Semantic Communication goes beyond traditional bit-level communication by focusing on the meaning of the transmitted information. It aims to improve communication efficiency by understanding and transmitting only the relevant semantic information required for the intended task.

## 📸 **Illustration of Semantic Communication Process**

Below is an example of the semantic communication process visualized during training:

- **Original Image**: The initial image fed into the semantic encoder.
- **Encoded Representation**: The compressed semantic representation of the original image.
- **Channel Output**: The representation after passing through the communication channel with noise.
- **Reconstructed Image**: The final output after decoding, approximating the original image.

This visualization showcases the transformation of information through the semantic encoder, noisy channel, and the decoder.
